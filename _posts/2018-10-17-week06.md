# Git-exercise-02

## Description

The goal of the exercise was to become more familiar with merging, pull requests and working as a team. There was a git-exercise-02 repository for each team member and each member had to create a function to output a different odd fact for each of the other members' main.cpp files. A pull request was then made to the repository's owner to be merged.

## How was it?

The exercise was straightfoward and gave practice on resolving merge conflicts and pull requests. It was quite easy, but still informative at the same time. Not many changes were made to the program between each person and that made merging much easier. The odd facts were interesting questions and topics that I had never thought about.
