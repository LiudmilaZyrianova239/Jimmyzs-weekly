# Bug Tracker

## GNOME bugzilla

This week I took a look at GNOME's [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.gnome.org/) bug tracker. GNOME is an free and open source project to create a desktop environment for Linux. The GNOME project has a small community, but it is an active one. There were more than 30 bug reports opened and closed in a single week. I noticed that most of the top contributors' lists for the past 7 days had a few overlaps. The contributions for the projects are top heavy in that the top five contributors on each list account for half of the contributions. The list give an indication on the most active members and the most familiar with the project. The colors and definitions of the bug tracker's keywords are self-explanatory.
