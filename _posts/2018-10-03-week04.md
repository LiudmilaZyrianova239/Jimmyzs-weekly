# Teams
> This week I have been added to a team with f0cus10 and FrancisXIrizarry. We read and made
> changes to each other's week 1 and 2 posts to fix grammar mistakes. It was interesting reading about
> my teammates' thoughts about the open source activities. 

# Avoiding Confusion
> We decided to avoid confusion and extra work by creating a plan. Instead of having everyone edit each other's posts
> and creating merge conflicts, the work was divided before we began. There was some initial confusion that ended
> be not mattering. f0cus10 created the division of work in which, I forked f0cus10's repository, f0cus10 forked
> FrancisXIrizarry's repository and FrancisXIrizarry forks my repository. It was not seen that Francis had
> already forked f0cus10's repository, but since no one had started to work yet, we were able to sort it out. I think
> working as a team and pre-planning what we do is very important and saves a lot of time and work. The time that it
> takes to organize a task is much lower than the time it takes to fix mistakes from poor management.
