# Git Workflow

## Git

> This week I read about [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). Git is a very useful
> tool for version control and helps keep code organized in a group environment.
> A tutorial for Git is [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git).
> Git is a tool that is definitely worth learning because it keeps track
> of the versions of a project and easily spot the difference between updated code
> from multiple members or from a previous version.

## Git Exercise

> The excercise was to learn how one would contribute to a project. A project is forked and cloned onto
> a local computer to have your own copy to work on without affecting others. After an improvement is made
> to the project, the changes can be pushed back into your personal repository and a pull request could be made
> to add the changes to the blessed repository.
> The exercise was a helpful guide on working with Git and taught me how I would be able to contribute to projects.
> It was overall an easy to follow exercise to learn Git workflow.
