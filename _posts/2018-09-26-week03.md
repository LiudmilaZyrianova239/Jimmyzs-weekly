# Git Work-flow

## Git

> This week I read about [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). Git is a very useful
> tool for version control and helps keep code organized in a group environment.
> A tutorial for Git is [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/courses/git).
> Git is definitely worth learning because it keeps track of the versions of a project and 
> allows for easy spotting of differences between the updated code and the current version.

## Git Exercise

> The exercise was to learn how one could contribute to a project. In the exercise, the project is forked and cloned onto
> a local computer to have a personal copy to work on without affecting others. After an addition is made
> to the project, the changes can be pushed back into the personal repository on Github and a pull request could be initiated
> to add the changes to the blessed repository.
> This exercise was a helpful guide on working with Git and taught me how I would work in a team environment.
> It was overall an easy to follow exercise to learn Git work-flow.
