# OpenStreetMap
  This week I learned about OpenStreetMap and included my own edits to make the map more accurate. While looking
  through OpenStreetMap around my area, I noticed that basically everything was blank. There were stores and buildings
  that were there for decades that have never been added to the map and it seems the satellite images are also 
  outdated. I added the names of a few places. Some of what I labeled include a Jewish Chapel that is also a funeral home,
  a T-Mobile store and a recently opened up funiture store.
